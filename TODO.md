### Milestone 1  
1. Render local player circle differently than server player circles.
2. Restructure code so that it can be tested.
3. Implement entity interpolation.
4. Implement client-side prediction.
5. Implement server reconciliation.

At this point, players should be able to move their circles left and right, with
everything happening smoothly.

### Milestone 2
1. Introduce some mechanism for clients to "mispredict" (maybe add collisions between circles).
